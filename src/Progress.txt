WTF 2 do:

DONE:	Make it so that gameclient translates the avatar, not just changes the vector
		on that note, remove the vector, it's not used anywhere else.
		
DONE:	sendMoveMessage is not used anywhere, add it to update.

DONE: Replace NPC with ball mine.

Make AI react to ghost avatar as well

Replace custom OrbitCameraController with built in camera controller.

DONE: Create model/(optional animation) in blendr and add it to game.

DONE: Add entity class to store model in it.

Go over Movement classes and make sure they actually go in the correct direction.

Make sure to add an event and event listener to the game.
